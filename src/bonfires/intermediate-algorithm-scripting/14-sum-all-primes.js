/* Bonfire: Sum All Primes

 *
 * Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.
 *
 * A prime number is defined as having only two divisors, 1 and itself.
 * For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.
 * 1 isn't a prime number, because it's only divisible by itself.
 *
 * The provided number may not be a prime.
